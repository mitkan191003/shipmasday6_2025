STL Models Folder
=================

Place your .stl files here. Each scene can reference a model by filename.

File naming convention:
- scene-00-shirt.stl
- scene-01-bin.stl
- scene-02-landfill.stl
- scene-03-threads.stl
- scene-04-fiber.stl
- scene-05-washer.stl
- scene-06-ocean.stl
- scene-07-methane.stl
- scene-08-globe.stl
- scene-09-shirt-mended.stl

Or use any name and reference it in data/scenes.ts under the "model" field.

The models will be:
- Colored with the ember/orange highlight (#ff6b35)
- Rotated gently back and forth
- Scrolled up off-screen when the scene ends
